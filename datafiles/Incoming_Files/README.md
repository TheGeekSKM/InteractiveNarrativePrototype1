# Greetings!

Hello, nephew. I trust you and your father are doing well.

I basically gave you the easiest first job. You see, this Geralt fellow is quite evil and killed my good friend Ostrit.
I strong recommend that you cite Ostrit's death report as evidence and deny the claim and you'll get this job permanently!!

ok.

BTW, don't look up me, Ostrit, Segelin, Foltest, or the Princess ok? you don't need to ask margaret
